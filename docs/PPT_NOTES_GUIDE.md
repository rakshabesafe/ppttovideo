## üé≠ Advanced Features: Emotion and Emphasis Control

### Emotion Tags

Control the emotional tone of your narration using `[EMOTION:type]` tags:

```
[EMOTION:excited] Welcome to our amazing product launch! 
This is going to be the best quarter yet!

[EMOTION:calm] Let's take a moment to review the technical specifications 
in detail.

[EMOTION:serious] We need to address some concerns raised by our customers 
regarding data security.
```

**Supported Emotions:**
- `happy` - Upbeat, cheerful tone
- `excited` - Enthusiastic, energetic
- `calm` - Relaxed, measured pace  
- `serious` - Professional, formal tone
- `neutral` - Default, natural tone

### Speed Control

Adjust speech speed using `[SPEED:value]` tags:

```
[SPEED:slow] Let me explain this complex concept step by step.

[SPEED:fast] Now let's quickly run through the key metrics.

[SPEED:0.8] This technical section requires careful attention.

[SPEED:1.3] Moving on to our exciting marketing initiatives!
```

**Speed Options:**
- `slow` = 0.7x speed (30% slower)
- `normal` = 1.0x speed (default)
- `fast` = 1.3x speed (30% faster)
- Custom values: `0.5` to `2.0` (e.g., `[SPEED:1.5]`)

### Emphasis and Pauses

#### Word Emphasis
Make specific words stand out using `[EMPHASIS:word]` tags:

```
Our revenue increased by [EMPHASIS:forty percent] this quarter, 
making this our [EMPHASIS:best performance] ever.

The [EMPHASIS:critical] issue is customer satisfaction, 
not just [EMPHASIS:profit margins].
```

#### Strategic Pauses
Add natural pauses using `[PAUSE:seconds]` tags:

```
We have three main points to cover today. [PAUSE:2] 
First, revenue growth. [PAUSE:1] 
Second, market expansion. [PAUSE:1] 
And finally, our strategic roadmap.
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### How Notes Are Processed

1. **Extraction**: Notes are extracted from PowerPoint files during upload
2. **Tag Parsing**: The system identifies and processes emotion, speed, and emphasis tags
3. **Text Processing**: Tags are removed and text is cleaned for TTS
4. **Speech Generation**: MeloTTS generates base audio with specified parameters
5. **Voice Cloning**: OpenVoice applies your selected voice characteristics
6. **Audio Assembly**: Final audio is synchronized with slide timing

### Supported File Formats
- `.pptx` files (PowerPoint 2007+)
- Notes must be in **English** for optimal results
- UTF-8 encoding support for special characters

## üìã Best Practices

### Writing Effective Notes

1. **Natural Language**: Write as you would speak, not as formal text
2. **Appropriate Length**: 30-150 words per slide for optimal pacing
3. **Clear Pronunciation**: Spell out acronyms (e.g., "API" as "A P I")
4. **Sentence Structure**: Use shorter sentences for better speech flow

### Using Tags Effectively

1. **Emotion Consistency**: Use emotions that match your slide content
2. **Strategic Pauses**: Add pauses at natural breaking points
3. **Emphasis Sparingly**: Highlight only the most important words/phrases
4. **Speed Variation**: Use speed changes to create engagement and focus

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå **Don't**: Overuse emotion tags - they should enhance, not distract
‚ùå **Don't**: Make notes too long - aim for 30-150 words per slide  
‚ùå **Don't**: Use complex punctuation - simple periods and commas work best
‚ùå **Don't**: Include presentation instructions - focus on narration content

‚úÖ **Do**: Test different voice clones to find the best match for your content
‚úÖ **Do**: Preview generated audio before final video creation
‚úÖ **Do**: Use consistent emotional tone throughout related slides
‚úÖ **Do**: Include natural conversational elements like "Now," "Next," "Finally"
